##Summary
Hello! I’m an enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering freshman with a passion for technology, programming, and design. I love exploring how innovative designs can enhance performance and efficiency. I’m eager to dive into the world of programming, constantly seeking to expand my skills in coding and software design.
Outside of academics, I’m a dedicated volleyball player. The teamwork and strategy involved in the sport reflect my approach to collaborative projects in my studies and future career. I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals, share ideas, and explore opportunities that combine my engineering background with my love for design and technology. 
Let’s connect and innovate together!
